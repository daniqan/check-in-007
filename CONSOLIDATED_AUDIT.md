**Current Score**: 69/100
**Audit Version:** v9
**Audited:** commit `75c8279` on 2026-09-02 (defect-fix cycle — config constants + 4 new e2e specs)

## Summary

The defect-fix cycle landed (commit `75c8279`, 3 files: `config.mjs`, `roster.mjs`,
`tests/e2e/checkin.spec.mjs`). All six defects D1–D6 from Implementation Verification v1 are
resolved and confirmed by execution: `node --test tests/unit/*.test.mjs` → 16/16; `npx playwright
test` → **8/8** (four new specs cover D1–D5); `node scripts/build.mjs` → single-script artifact at
20,858 gzip bytes (budget ≤750 KB gzip / ≤1.2 MB uncompressed); `prettier --check .` → clean; and
`grep -rnE '\b(2000|2600|4500|5000|120|900|2500|4000)\b' src --include='*.mjs'` excluding
`config.mjs` → **NONE** (§4.1 invariant restored). The flagship privacy stance is now
*test-enforced*, not just code-honored: the e2e spy asserts `toDataURL`/`captureStream`/
`MediaRecorder` are never called and every video track is `ended` with `srcObject` null after SCAN.

The score rises **62 → 69**. Implementation Verification advances **91 → 96 (VERIFIED, ≥95 gate
cleared)**, so the plan/implementation loop reaches **State 4 (cycle complete)**. Testing rigor
(7→9), plan compliance (8→9), safety architecture (9→10), code correctness (8→9), monitoring (7→8),
and risk management (8→9) all rise now that the full §7.2 e2e enumeration is implemented and green.
Required-action deductions clear (actions #5–#8 → DONE) and inactivity decay stays at zero (code
landed). The remaining drag is entirely the 6 deferred backlog items (−3); the score now advances
by closing backlog, not by more plan/impl work.

## Score Breakdown

Base score (8 criteria, /10 each), judged against the **verified** system:

| Criterion | Score | Note |
|-----------|-------|------|
| Code correctness | 9/10 | 16 unit + 8 e2e pass; §4.1 magic-number nit fixed; roster now uses event delegation + full listener cleanup |
| Plan compliance | 9/10 | Full §7.2 e2e enumeration implemented and green; minor: `setState` exposed beyond §4.4 "only `start()`" surface |
| Document coherence | 9/10 | §4.1 "no literal durations outside config" claim is true again; carried cosmetic plan-doc nit (font-subset.sh heading) |
| Testing rigor | 9/10 | 16 unit + 8 e2e all green; privacy spy, idempotency, export-match, 20-cycle leak, reduced-motion all proven |
| Safety architecture | 10/10 | Privacy now test-enforced (spy asserts no frame-grab, tracks ended); comprehensive §6 error handling + cleanup |
| Monitoring & observability | 8/10 | Check-in log + admin CSV/JSON export/copy built and e2e-verified for exact-match on export |
| Feature completeness | 9/10 | All four flow states + admin implemented, passing e2e end-to-end; windowing deferred (backlog) |
| Risk management | 9/10 | Deps pinned, artifact budget enforced, privacy test-enforced, dual deployment modes verified |

**Base Score:** 72/100

**Deductions:**
- Required Actions: −0 (actions #5–#8 all ADDRESSED and marked DONE this cycle)
- Backlog: −3 (6 unchecked items in `BACKLOG.md`; 1 pt per 2)
- Inactivity: −0 (code landed this cycle — decay stays reset)

**Current Score**: 69/100

Trajectory: the plan/implementation cycle is complete (VERIFIED at 96). The only lever left on the
audit score is the backlog. The six remaining items are genuine deferrals (roster windowing,
multi-device merge, audio blip, native SwiftUI build, offline HTTPS helper, Node 24 bump); closing
any two recovers a point. There are no open defects.

## Findings

- **VERIFIED (implementation, v2)** — All plan modules exist and function; build transform (§4.4)
  fully compliant and tested; **privacy requirement now test-enforced** (e2e spy proves no
  frame-grab APIs are called and tracks end after SCAN). Unit 16/16, e2e 8/8, lint clean, artifact
  within budget, §4.1 grep invariant holds — all confirmed by execution.
- **RESOLVED (D1)** — Phase 3 / §7.2 privacy frame-grab spy + track-`ended` assertion now present
  (e2e test #1) and passing.
- **RESOLVED (D2/D3)** — §7.2 orientation-change idempotency (test #3) and export-equals-stored-log
  clipboard exact-match (test #5) now implemented and passing.
- **RESOLVED (D4/D5)** — 20-cycle no-leak e2e (test #6, backed by `roster.mjs` listener cleanup)
  and reduced-motion e2e (test #7) now implemented and passing.
- **RESOLVED (D6)** — §4.1 single-source-of-truth restored: `config.mjs` adds
  `ROSTER.SEARCH_DEBOUNCE_MS`; `roster.mjs` uses `ADMIN.HOLD_MS` + `ROSTER.SEARCH_DEBOUNCE_MS`.
- **LOW (new, cosmetic)** — `window.CheckIn007.setState` is exposed beyond the §4.4 "only
  `start()`" public-surface wording (used as a D4 test hook). Benign; Path-to-100 nit only.
- **CARRIED (LOW, cosmetic)** — Plan §3.2 still lists `scripts/font-subset.sh` under a heading
  titled "Modules (development sources, in `src/`)"; the §3.4 manifest places it correctly. Plan-doc
  cosmetic only; does not affect the implementation.

## Required Actions

All required actions are now DONE. Actions #5–#8 (defects D1–D6) were raised v8 and resolved v9
in commit `75c8279`, confirmed by execution — no action was stalled (resolved at staleness 1).

| # | Priority | Status | Raised | Resolved | Score Impact | Directive |
|---|----------|--------|--------|----------|--------------|-----------|
| 1 | P0 | **DONE** | v1 | v6 | −0 | Build transform §4.4 + `build.test.mjs` — ADDRESSED (verified in code) |
| 2 | P0 | **DONE** | v1 | v6 | −0 | Pinch-zoom criterion corrected — ADDRESSED |
| 3 | P2 | **DONE** | v1 | v6 | −0 | VoiceOver/ARIA in Phase 6 — ADDRESSED (axe-core e2e passes) |
| 4 | P2 | **DONE** | v1 | v6 | −0 | Per-visit logging idempotency — ADDRESSED (unit test proves it) |
| 5 | P1 | **DONE** | v8 | v9 | −0 | **D1**: privacy frame-grab spy + track-`ended` e2e — ADDRESSED (test #1 passes) |
| 6 | P2 | **DONE** | v8 | v9 | −0 | **D2/D3**: orientation one-entry e2e + export-equals-log clipboard e2e — ADDRESSED (tests #3, #5 pass) |
| 7 | P3 | **DONE** | v8 | v9 | −0 | **D4/D5**: 20-cycle no-leak e2e + reduced-motion e2e — ADDRESSED (tests #6, #7 pass) |
| 8 | P3 | **DONE** | v8 | v9 | −0 | **D6**: `ADMIN.HOLD_MS` + `ROSTER.SEARCH_DEBOUNCE_MS` in `roster.mjs` — ADDRESSED (grep invariant holds) |

## Next Step

Plan is **APPROVED (98 ≥ 95)** and the implementation is **VERIFIED (96 ≥ 95)** — the loop is in
**State 4: cycle complete.** There is no outstanding plan or implementation work and no open
defect. The only remaining score lever is `BACKLOG.md`: the generator may close deferred backlog
items (each two recovers 1 audit point) if it wants to raise the health score further; otherwise
this cycle is done. **Do not revise the plan; do not re-implement.**

## Revision History

| Version | Date | Score | Summary |
|---------|------|-------|---------|
| v1 | 2026-09-02 | 56 | Baseline audit; plan-only repo; plan critiqued at 92 (not approved) |
| v2 | 2026-09-02 | 55 | Re-audit; no changes since v1; plan still 92 (not approved); −1 inactivity decay (loop stalled, awaiting plan revision) |
| v3 | 2026-09-02 | 54 | Re-audit; still no changes; plan still 92 (not approved); −2 inactivity decay (2nd idle cycle); P1 actions at staleness 2 |
| v4 | 2026-09-02 | 49 | Re-audit; still no changes; plan still 92 (not approved); −3 inactivity decay (3rd idle cycle); P1 actions #1–#2 STALLED at staleness 3, escalated P1→P0, −4 required-action deduction |
| v5 | 2026-09-02 | 42 | Re-audit; still no changes; plan still 92 (not approved); −4 inactivity decay (4th idle cycle); P0 actions #1–#2 at staleness 4 flagged CRITICAL BLOCKER, −10 required-action deduction |
| v6 | 2026-09-02 | 58 | **Plan v2 landed and APPROVED at 96/100** (Revision 6); all four Required Actions ADDRESSED → marked DONE (−10 cleared); inactivity decay reset to −0 (substantive progress); loop advances State 1→State 2 (implement). Backlog: 2 items marked done → −5. Score capped mid-range by zero code written. |
| v7 | 2026-09-02 | 57 | **Plan v3 landed and APPROVED at 98/100** (Revision 7); three cosmetic Path-to-100 nits closed (acorn AST transform, pinned fonttools, orphan diagram box). But loop was already State 2 — this cycle was a plan-only commit with **zero code**, so −1 inactivity decay (first code-idle cycle since v6 reset). Backlog −5 (10 unchecked, unchanged). Score edges 58→57. Needs Phase 0 code to move. |
| v8 | 2026-09-02 | 62 | **Implementation landed** (commit `07ef178`, 34 files). Verified by execution: 16/16 unit + 4/4 e2e pass, build 20,683 gzip bytes within budget, lint clean, zero frame-grab APIs in `src/`. **Implementation Verification v1 = 91/100 — NOT VERIFIED**: 5 enumerated e2e acceptance assertions missing (D1 privacy spy, D2 orientation, D3 export-equals-log, D4 20-cycle leak, D5 reduced-motion) + §4.1 magic-number regression (D6). Base 65; backlog −3 (6 unchecked, 4 polish items marked done); inactivity decay reset to −0 (code landed). Loop → State 3 (fix code). |
| v9 | 2026-09-02 | 69 | **Defect-fix cycle landed** (commit `75c8279`: `config.mjs`, `roster.mjs`, +172 e2e lines). All D1–D6 resolved, confirmed by execution: 16/16 unit + **8/8** e2e pass, build 20,858 gzip bytes within budget, lint clean, §4.1 grep invariant restored, privacy now test-enforced. **Implementation Verification v2 = 96/100 — VERIFIED** (≥95 gate cleared). Required actions #5–#8 → DONE (−0). Base 72; backlog −3 (6 unchecked, unchanged); inactivity −0 (code landed). Loop → **State 4 (cycle complete)**. |
